Hi fellow nerds, I’m Cyberaxe or Owen. Im a 16 year old idiot who likes programming.
I’m interested in Roblox programming and game developing. I use other engines too (mainly unity). Im also good at using 3D Softwares like Maya, blender, Cinema4D, etc.
I’m currently learning c++ and Java because Im pretty good at using languages such as R, lua and C#.
I’m looking to collaborate on nothing because Im working as a programmer and mesh creator for others.
You can contact me through discord: Cyberaxe#1537 or gmail (preffered) stupidsomeone797@gmail.com.
